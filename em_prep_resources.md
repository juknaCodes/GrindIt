# Essential Resources for Google L6/L7 Engineering Manager Prep

This list provides curated, high-impact resources organized by the three main interview pillars: Leadership (L), System Design (SD), and Coding/Code Review (C).

## 1. Leadership and Behavioral Interviews (L)

The goal here is to master the STAR method and demonstrate L6/L7 scope (multi-team, cross-functional, strategic influence).

| Resource Type | Recommended Content | Focus Area | 
 | ----- | ----- | ----- | 
| **Books** | **The Manager's Path** (Camille Fournier) | Career growth, team structure, managing managers. | 
|  | **Radical Candor** (Kim Scott) | Feedback, coaching, managing performance. | 
|  | **High Output Management** (Andy Grove) | Management principles, leveraging time, decision-making. | 
| **Frameworks** | **S.T.A.R. Method** | Structure for all behavioral answers (Situation, Task, Action, Result). | 
|  | **S.A.R.A. Framework** | Handling conflicts (Shock, Anger, Resolution, Acceptance). | 
| **Google Focus** | Read Google's **L6/L7 EM Job Descriptions** | Understand expected scope, "Googley-ness," and scale. | 
|  | **"How Google Works"** (Eric Schmidt, Jonathan Rosenberg) | Insight into Google culture, speed, and product principles. | 

## 2. System Design Interviews (SD)

L6/L7 System Design requires deep familiarity with trade-offs, scalability bottlenecks, and distributed concepts.

| Resource Type | Recommended Content | Focus Area | 
 | ----- | ----- | ----- | 
| **Courses/Guides** | **Grokking the System Design Interview** (Educative) | Foundational overview and common problems (News Feed, Twitter). | 
|  | **System Design Primer** (GitHub Repository) | Comprehensive, categorized list of topics and case studies. | 
| **Books** | **Designing Data-Intensive Applications** (Martin Kleppmann) | The definitive guide for distributed systems, consistency, and storage. | 
| **Key Concepts** | **Consistency Models** (CAP Theorem, Eventual Consistency, Linearizability) | Trade-offs in distributed data. | 
|  | **Load Balancers** (L4 vs. L7), **Proxies**, **CDNs** | Network flow and distribution. | 
|  | **Databases** (SQL vs. NoSQL, Sharding, Replication, Indexing) | Data storage and retrieval at scale. | 
|  | **Message Queues** (Kafka, RabbitMQ, Pub/Sub) | Asynchronous communication and reliability. | 
| **Practice** | Design: **URL Shortener**, **Twitter Timeline/Feed**, **Distributed Cache**, **Google Search/Crawler**, **Notification System**. | Core L6/L7 design problems. |

## 3. Coding and Code Review (C)

For the EM role, Coding and Code Review assess technical credibility, clean coding skills, and the ability to mentor on design.

| Resource Type | Recommended Content | Focus Area | 
 | ----- | ----- | ----- | 
| **Platforms** | **LeetCode** (Medium difficulty) | Focus on **Arrays, Hashmaps, Strings, Trees/Graphs, and Dynamic Programming**. | 
|  | **HackerRank** | Good for focused skill practice. | 
| **Conceptual Review** | **SOLID Principles** (Single responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov, Interface segregation, Dependency inversion) | Object-Orientred Design (OOD) foundations. | 
|  | **Common Design Patterns** (Factory, Singleton, Observer) | Writing maintainable and extensible code. | 
| **Code Review** | **Google Style Guides** (Python, Java, Go, etc.) | Understand Google's best practices for readability and consistency. | 
|  | **Analyze Open Source Pull Requests** | Practice articulating clear, actionable, and diplomatic feedback (the core of the Code Review round). | 

## 4. Google-Specific & Mindset

| Resource Type | Recommended Content | Focus Area | 
 | ----- | ----- | ----- | 
| **Preparation** | **Behavioral Interview Questions for Managers** (Google searches) | Practice common questions specifically targeting L6/L7 scope (e.g., "Tell me about a time you had to change the technical direction of a large team"). | 
|  | **Mock Interviews** | Use platforms like Pramp or find senior EM peers. This is the **most crucial** step in Phase 3. | 
| **Mindset** | **Practice whiteboarding designs** | Get comfortable drawing and explaining under pressure. | 
|  | **Timing** | Time yourself strictly for both Coding (30-40 mins) and System Design (45 mins). |
